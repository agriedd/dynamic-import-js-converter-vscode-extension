# dynamic-import-js-converter README

I made this extension just to convert dynamic import to static import in js file
i've had a propblem that when in development im using dynamic import on vue router
then when on production face a difficult to refactor bunch of dynamic import into 
static import. so i made this extension.

in the feature maybe i should add more feature like add user interface, convert 
from static to dynamic import, choose separate line of the code to convert or anything else

## How To Use

To use this extension 
`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Windows) then Choose or find *Convert: Dynamic To Static Import*

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Known Issues
